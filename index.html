    <h4>1. <em>Paris in the Rain</em> by Lauv</h4>
    <p>
      Lauv is my favorite artist of all time. All of his songs could make this list. I put Paris in the Rain because it was the first song Iâ€™ve ever heard by Lauv. <em>Paris in the Rain</em> evokes memories of my older brother for me, because we both love Lauv's music.

    <h4>3. <em>I Want It That Way</em> by Backstreet Boys</h4>
    <p>
      This song means a lot to me because it reminds me of my dad, who played this around the house growing up. I get a feeling of home whenever I listen to <em>I Want It That Way</em>. It is also my go-to karaoke song!

    <h4>4. <em>Sunday Morning</em> by Matoma</h4>

    <h4>5. <em>Burn</em> from <em>Hamilton</em></h4>
    <p>
      I absolutely love every song on the <em>Hamilton</em> soundtrack. I chose <em>Burn</em> because it's such a powerful and angry song. I got to see <em>Hamilton</em> with one of my best friends, so this is a good memory for me.

    <h4>6. <em>Cruise - Remix</em> by Florida Georgia Line</h4>
    <p>
      Country music is my guilty pleasure. I listen to this song whenever my friends and I are driving down the highway, so it hypes us up. <em>Cruise</em> just reminds me of all the fun trips that I get to go with my best friends, and how amazing and precious our friendship is.

    <h4>9. <em>Run the World (Girls)</em> by Beyonce</h4>
    <p>
      Because I'm all about female empowerment, and the strongest people I know are women, such as my mom.

    <h4>13. <em>I'll Make a Man Out of You</em> from <em>Mulan</em></h4>
    <p>
      <em>I'll Make a Man Out of You</em> is my favorite Disney song from my favorite Disney movie. I've always loved Disney movies growing up. <em>Mulan</em> was the first time I saw someone who looked like me on film, so it was empowering to see someone like her on TV.
